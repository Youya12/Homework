The landing page design for the perfume website focuses on elegance, sophistication, and user-friendliness. 
Here's a breakdown of the design choices:

 1-Color Scheme: The color palette predominantly consists of shades of purple (#63275c) combined with white 
 and hints of light pink. Purple is often associated with luxury, creativity, and elegance, which aligns well 
 with the theme of fragrances.

 2-Typography: The "Pacifico" font was chosen for the brand name in the navbar and footer, adding a touch of 
 whimsy and elegance. The rest of the text uses default sans-serif fonts, ensuring readability and simplicity.

 3-Navbar: The navbar has a fixed-top position for easy navigation. It incorporates the brand logo along with
  clear navigation links, ensuring accessibility to different sections of the website (local links).

 4-Hero Section: The hero section features a captivating background image with overlay text. The background 
 image conveys the essence of luxury and beauty associated with fragrances. The overlay text is placed to the 
 left, allowing ample space for the image to be shown.

 5-Buttons: The call-to-action (CTA) button in the hero section and the "Shop Now" buttons under each product 
 card have a consistent design. They feature bold text, uppercase styling, and a hover effect, encouraging 
 users to take action.

 6-Product Display: Products are showcased in a grid layout under different fragrance categories. Each product 
 card includes an image, product details, and a "Shop Now" button. Hover effects are applied to the product 
 images for interactivity.

 7-Responsive Design: Media queries are used to ensure that the layout adapts well to different screen sizes. 
 The design remains visually appealing and functional across various devices, including mobile phones, 
 as shown in the screenshots.

 8-Footer: The footer section includes essential information such as the brand name, social media links, and 
 legal links. It maintains the color scheme and typography consistency seen throughout the website.

Overall, the design choices aim to create a visually appealing and user-friendly experience for visitors 
interested in exploring and purchasing fragrances from our website.
